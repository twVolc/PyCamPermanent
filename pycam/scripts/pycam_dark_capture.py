"""
Script runs in a similar was to pycam_masterpi, initiating all other neccessary scripts, but it then just requests
that the instruments run their dark capture procedure (acquirign darks at all shutter speeds). Following this the
script shutsdown.
NOTE: pycam_masterpi should not be running at the time of starting this script - it will be killed if it is. This is
preferred to just connecting to that pycam_masterpi instance and requesting dark images because pycam_masterpi could
later be killed by a scheduled kill request
Also the Raspberry Pi must be turned on at the time that this script is scheduled to start!
